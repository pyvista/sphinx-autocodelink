# sphinx-autocodelink

Automatically add links to code blocks in Sphinx documentation.

This extension is similar to [sphinx-codeautolink](https://github.com/felix-hilden/sphinx-codeautolink),
except it uses dynamic analysis to resolve links instead of static analysis.
The dynamic analysis is based on how [Sphinx-Gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io) resolves links
for its `'reference_url'` configuration option.

## Installation

```bash
pip install sphinx-autocodelink
```

Add the extension to your Sphinx `conf.py`:

```python
extensions = [
    ...,
    'sphinx-autocodelink',
]
```

## Development

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```
